## Overview
ku4web-components is a crazy sweet, suite of fully-customizable Web Components
that enable rapid development of responsive, scalable, maintainable,
accessible web front-ends. And by "rapid" we mean _really fast!_

Just a line or two of declarative HTML for excellent features like
carousels, drawers, modals, forms, validation, tab-lists, focus-traps, etc.

Zero JavaScript. Zero cumbersome state-management wiring. Zero boilerplate.
Just a few simple lines of declarative HTML!

And if that wasn't great enough
they are compatible with the code you already have. They can be added to
any project that supports HTML. If you can render HTML, you can render ku4web-components!
