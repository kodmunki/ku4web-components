Simple, declarative web components for, insanely, fast development of
responsive, scalable, maintainable,accessible web front-ends.

Form validation, grids, carousels, focus-trap, tab-lists... in 
Angular, React, Vue, and Web apps. All the same declarative, NO-hassle
code.

NO JavaScript. NO cumbersome FE state-management wiring. NO boilerplate.

Just a few simple lines of declarative HTML, compatible with the code you
already have, and portable across all platforms with.

Write it once. Use it everywhere.
