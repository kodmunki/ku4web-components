/**
 * ku4web-components follows a "mobile-first" design
 * strategy and uses the following breakpoints for
 * the corresponding commented sizes.
 *
 * Note that because ku4web-components follow a
 * "mobile-first" design strategy each breakpoint is
 * relevant for its labeled size and any size larger.
 * The means, for example, that styling at extra-small
 * will style for all sizes unless otherwise overridden
 * at a breakpoint for a larger size.
 *
 * Any exceptions to the mobile-first design strategy
 * e.g. styles for extra-small only, will be noted in
 * the given component's template.css and example.css.
 *
 * You can find the template.css and any example.css
 * for your target VERSION which can be found at:
 * https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4web-components/tree/VERSION/styles
 * and the necessary @media query block will be there
 * and commented for your convenience.
